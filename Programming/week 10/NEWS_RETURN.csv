However, Barnes & Noble (BKS +4.8%), whose Nook Tablet goes for $199-$249, is actually spiking higher. Amazon (AMZN +1.5%) is largely unchanged.

Though expecting SolarCity to hit its 2013 deployment target of 250MW, Needham now sees less upside. On the earnings call, SolarCity mentioned it's talking with ratings agencies to lower financing costs for installations - the company recently refinanced some early debt to 3.45% from a prior 8%. Even after accounting for financing funds, SolarCity expects to burn cash over the next 3 quarters before again turning net cash flow positive.

A ""hail mary pass,"" says Oppenheimer's Shaul Eyal. The transaction is a ""call option on mobile,"" he says, where Microsoft stands to maybe see a positive result without risking too much money. The catalysts of a dividend hike, a potential new CEO, and shareholder activism could outweigh any negativity from this deal, he hopes, maintaining his Buy rating and $37 price target.

GOOG|"After meeting with Google Glass (GOOG) LCOS microdisplay supplier Himax (HIMX +5.3%), Chardan's Jay Srivatsa reports Google has prompted Himax to ramp production, and thinks Glass will see a full commercial launch in Q1 2014. He adds Google might launch more than one Glass model, to cater to those needing prescription glasses.
Srivasta believes Himax has already raised microdisplay production to 500K units/month from a prior 200K/month, and is set to produce 850K/month by the end of Q1.
Pricing for a commercial version of Glass remains a mystery. The developer edition was sold earlier this year for $1,500. Google has said it doesn't plan to run ads on Glass, and wants to profit from hardware sales.
Himax also told Srivasta it's in the ""early stages of ramping [microdisplay] production for another company,"" which the analyst believes is Microsoft (MSFT -2.5%). Himax thinks the company's product could launch in mid-2014.
Meanwhile, TechCrunch reports Microsoft might spend up to $200M to buy wearable computing patents and assets from military contractor Osterhout Design. Osterhout has worked on head-mounted displays in the past, among many other products.

Calls for a breakup have grown lately.

Morgan Stanley (Equal Weight) points out Microsoft is guiding for FY14 capex of $6.5B, up 51% from FY13's $4.3B and above the firm's estimate of $5.6B. Microsoft attributes the spending ramp to cloud services (Azure, Xbox Live, Office 365) needs. The firm is, however, pleased with the rapid FY13 growth reported for Office 365 seats (+350%), Azure (+200%), and cloud CRM software (+80%).

Citi (Buy) had only been expecting FY14 capex guidance of $4.8B. But it likes Microsoft's new reporting structure, arguing it will ""give more clear visibility into consumer vs commercial revenue and profit contribution.""

Among those events is a new operating structure with greater transparency on the best assets, or what MacMillan calls ""BestCo"" - the commercial segment containing key assets transitioning to the cloud. ""OtherCo"" is the devices and consumer segment which carry less clear value. MacMillan sees the market allowing a higher valuation to the BestCo operations.
As for the new CEO, MacMillan sees the potential for better portfolio focus - i.e. which assets should remain as core and what should be viewed as non-core - as well as someone who sees the company's massive recurring cash flows as opportunity to give more back to shareholders.

AMZN|"At its annual re:Invent conference, Amazon Web Services (AMZN +1.2%) has unveiled WorkSpaces, a PC virtualization offering that allows businesses to host virtual desktops on Amazon's cloud infrastructure.
PC virtualization/thin client software leader Citrix (CTXS -3.7%) dived following the product launch, but has recouped some of its losses following news the company is an AWS PC virtualization partner. Top Citrix rival VMware (VMW +0.2%) has fallen moderately, but is still near breakeven.
Amazon asserts WorkSpaces is easier to manage than traditional PC virtualization offerings, and also carries much lower up-front costs. AWS chief Andy Jassy: ""Virtual desktops are difficult to set up, they’re difficult to manage, you have to worry about the hardware, the virtual desktop infrastructure ... We wondered if there were an easier way.""
WorkSpaces is priced fairly aggressively - Amazon is charging $35-$60/month per user, depending on the plan, and doesn't require any long-term commitments.
Also: AWS, which has depended heavily on Internet companies for its early growth, has bolstered its enterprise chops by adding support for SAML 2.0, a commonly-used identity management protocol. Adding SAML 2.0 support makes it easier for enterprises to manage access to, and enable single sign-on for, AWS-hosted services."|2013-11-13|0.03683926818708705|17.81100082397461

Shah states the 4.8% interest rate carried by SolarCity's notes is below the 6.5% rate he expected, and well below tax equity financing rates (can be as high as 15%). ""Bottom line, the Solarcity ABS transaction improves overall sector profitability and sets the stage for a lot stronger growth of the US solar market over the next 12-18 months.""

AMZN|"Several analysts argue Amazon's (AMZN +3.1%) cloud-based WorkSpaces PC virtualization platform could prove to be a long-term threat to Citrix (CTXS -5.4%) and VMware's (VMW -2.9%) on-premises offerings.
Nomura notes WorkSpaces is initially focused on SMBs, who tend to shy away from expensive on-premises deployments, rather than the enterprises Citrix derives a large portion of its sales from. But it still thinks the platform could become ""a serious and broader-based competitor if it ends up vying for larger enterprises."" Jefferies, meanwhile, calls WorkSpaces attractively priced and a threat to the majority of Citrix's business.
Stifel is defending Citrix. The firm argues Amazon is ""targeting the low-end of the DaaS market as it doesn’t offer the full range of features (or deployment options) that Citrix’s desktop solutions offer."" It's worth noting many cloud-based apps/services initially targeted SMBs before gradually moving upmarket.
Also: Amazon has launched AppStream, a service that allows apps hosted on its cloud infrastructure to be streamed to mobile devices (and perhaps eventually PCs). The service could end up acting as competition for Citrix and VMware's app virtualization platforms.
In addition to Amazon, Cisco's guidance is likely pressuring Citrix and VMware. Citrix and Cisco have an application delivery controller partnership, and VMware (though competing with Cisco in some areas) maintains a multi-faceted software alliance with the networking giant.
Last month, VMware bought Desktone, developer of a PC virtualization platform than can enable cloud-based services. VMware has promised to cross-sell Desktone's platform to its 11K service provider partners."|2013-11-14|0.05534274600035105|18.3700008392334

At the same time, Honan is a big fan of Glass' Google Now integration - ""[Now's] ambient location awareness, combined with previous Google searches, means extremely relevant notifications come to your attention in a way they just can’t on a smartphone."" - and states Glass made him ""hate"" using his phone due to the social withdrawal it produces.
Honan: ""Glass, and the other things like it, won’t always be ugly and awkward ... The future is on its way, and it is going to be on your face.""

AAPL|"""Our bullish thesis on Apple had been predicated on the expectation for gross margin expansion driven by the 5s cycle,"" says analyst Maynard Um, cutting Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Hold with the price target remaining in the $536-$581 range. ""While we still have conviction in the gross margin thesis (and the potential for iPad/iPhone unit upside), we believe this may be largely embedded into the valuation.""
Along with margins, Um is also concerned about limited market opportunity in Apple's existing product lines, and a shift in the balance of power from handset vendors back to wireless providers.
Shooting back, Jay Yarow says he believes Apple has long-term contracts with carriers, and what's commonly known as a ""subsidy"" to entice buyers to purchase iPhones is really a loan that is paid back as part of the monthly service cost.
Um isn't all negative, seeing positive 2014 catalysts like the iPhone 6, the iBeacon, the iWatch, and the chance for boosted capital returns.

Wedbush's Michael Pachter (Underperform) thinks ISPs could try to charge Netflix and others a fee for every GB of data transmitted over their networks. He notes each hour of SD and 1080p video streamed by Netflix to 40""-50"" TV sets respectively consumes 1GB and 6.5GB of data.
Though services such as Netflix drive demand for high-speed connections, U.S. ISPs (many of whom double as pay-TV providers) have nonetheless been upset over the streaming giant's heavy data consumption. Netflix has been trying to address the issue via its Open Connect CDN, but not all major ISPs are on board.
FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has already said his agency might appeal yesterday's ruling, so as to guarantee ""networks on which the Internet depends continue to provide a free and open platform for innovation and expression.""

On the CC (transcript), CFO Amy Hood stated the macro environment is ""a little better than [Microsoft] thought,"" and that enterprise Windows sales are benefiting both from Win. 7 upgrades and a shift towards more costly enterprise SKUs.

AAPL|"Apple (AAPL +1.2%) is rising going into today's FQ1 report, and PayPal parent eBay (EBAY -2%) is selling off, after the WSJ reported Apple is hatching plans for a mobile payments service. Point-of-sale hardware vendors VeriFone (PAY -2.3%) and NCR (NCR -2.6%) are also lower.
The report left some major questions unanswered. A big one: Will Apple's service only cover transactions taking place in physical stores, or will it also cover mobile e-commerce transactions?
The latter would be a much larger threat to PayPal, which handled $27B worth of mobile transactions (largely e-commerce-related) in 2013, but for now only has a small presence in the offline payments realm (the company is trying hard to change that).
Given Apple's history, an Apple payments service is unlikely to support Android. That could limit merchant interest in regions where Android has a dominant smartphone share (the EU, Latin America, parts of Asia), assuming Apple plans to take the service overseas.

Carl Icahn mentioned payments as a major growth opportunity for Apple last week, highlighting the company's ability to leverage its 575M+ iTunes accounts, fingerprint sensors, and iBeacon.

SunTrust's Robert Peck notes the midpoint of LinkedIn's 2014 revenue guidance range implies a 20% drop in revenue growth from 2013's 57% clip, a decline he considers ""excessive"" in light of the launch of new products such as sponsored news feed ads and Sales Navigator. LinkedIn has a long history of lowballing its revenue guidance.

Morgan Stanley thinks LinkedIn's margins could be ""flattish"" in 2014, but also believes improving ad sales and the rollout of LinkedIn's sales products could yield revenue upside.

LinkedIn mentioned on its CC (transcript) unique visiting members rose 31% Y/Y in spite of the site traffic slump, thanks in part to mobile growth, and that member page views rose 40%.
Corporate customers under contract rose 11% Q/Q and 49% Y/Y to over 24.5K; CFO Steven Sordello admits much of the new account growth now involves smaller clients, but adds ARPUs for larger clients are growing due to product cross-selling. To keep up its momentum, LinkedIn plans to grow its salesforce by over 30% in 2014.

AAPL|"""It’s difficult to imagine a world in which Comcast would give up its network and control of customers that are streaming data through such a service,"" writes TechCrunch's Ryan Lawler, demonstrating the skepticism that has followed the WSJ's report about Apple's (AAPL +1.1%) TV service talks with Comcast.
In addition to doubts about Comcast's support, there are questions about Apple's ability to reach deals with TV network owners. Intel's pay-TV ambitions were derailed by a failure to reach such deals; Verizon, which bought Intel's TV unit, is hoping to launch a Web TV service with the help of FiOS' existing deals.
Also: Many think regulators would scrutinize an arrangement that provides Apple's services with dedicated network capacity.
One of the WSJ's sources states Apple and Comcast aren't close to a deal, with differences over customer control and data remaining an issue. In addition, the Comcast/Time Warner Cable deal is said to have stalled talks between Apple and TWC to have a next-gen Apple TV set-top support TWC's content (a much simpler proposition).

9to5 Mac has reported a new Apple TV set-top could arrive in 1H14. iLounge and others have reported the device will feature game controller support.

Meanwhile, The Verge reports ""several big companies"" had made overtures to Oculus (no names are given), and that the startup's VC investors ""offered the company more money to go it alone.""
Over time, Oculus' Rift headset, which Facebook hopes will be used for many non-gaming applications, could compete against Google Glass. For now, they address different markets: Rift is much heavier/bulkier than Glass, but also provides an immersive VR/3D gaming experience.
During a CC, Mark Zuckerberg asserted the Rift is ""way ahead"" of rival products such as Sony's (SNE -0.4%) Morpheus (due in 2015), and that Oculus' talent is unmatched. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe argues Facebook's resources will help make the Rift cheaper (the dev. kit currently goes for $350).

Stacy Higginbotham remains an Oculus skeptic: While calling a demo she tried out ""immersive and neat,"" she adds it was ""nothing like real life."" Brad Stone thinks ""there's nothing social"" about headsets that ""[blot] out absolutely everything around you.""

Jim Edwards, defending the deal, calls the Rift the kind of product for which words can't describe ""how incredible the experience of wearing one is."" VC Chris Dixon, who backed Oculus, makes a similar case.
Some game developers are unhappy about the deal. As are some of the Kickstarter backers who poured $2.4M into Oculus, and only have t-shirts and dev. kits to show for it. Facebook has joined several other Internet momentum stocks in selling off in the wake of King's disappointing IPO.

Pac Crest (PT hiked by $10 to $530) notes total Q2 adds of 1.7M beat its forecast by 300K, and that lower marketing spend is offsetting higher content costs (thus driving margin expansion as revenue grows).

U.S. streaming margin was at 27.1% in Q2. 2) Reed Hastings declares the impact of Netflix's price hike on sub adds to be minimal. 3) Expenses related to paid peering deals are dwarfed by content costs. 4) 10%-20% of international content tends to be local fare. 5) Netflix sees its superior TV show library as a differentiator relative to Amazon's European service (formerly called Lovefilm).

Judging by the reaction to the company's EPS miss and guidance for a sizable Q3 op. loss, investor patience seems to be wearing thin.
Szkutak admitted Amazon Web Services' near-term growth has been hurt by an ongoing cloud infrastructure price war with Microsoft and Google - while North American ""Other"" revenue was up 38% Y/Y, it fell 3% Q/Q, and Y/Y growth decelerated from Q1's 60%.
He also suggests Amazon's Q3 bottom line will be pressured by a ""significant"" increase in video content spend. The company plans to spend $100M on original programming alone, as it tries to counter Netflix's big content investments and keep Prime renewal rates high.
On the bright side, Szkutak says Prime subscriptions are still growing well following this year's $20 price hike, and that Q2 subscriber adds topped year-ago levels (no specific numbers, as usual). CIRP survey data appears to back him up.
Regarding China, he states Amazon has ""a lot of interesting things"" planned, and will continue investing in the Middle Kingdom. Alibaba remains the Chinese e-commerce market's 800-lb. gorilla.

Marketing Solutions (ad sales, 20% of revenue) growth accelerated to 44% Y/Y in Q2 from 36% in Q1, and helped drive the Q2 beat. Growth had been pressured in prior quarters by a transition to sponsored news feed ads.
Talent Solutions (jobs, 60% of revenue) +49% vs. +50% in Q1. Subscriptions (20% of revenue) +44% vs. +46% in Q1. The U.S. was 60% of revenue, same as Q1.
Likely helping ad sales: Traffic to posts from publishers and ""influencers"" has more than doubled since February, when a new publishing platform was launched. LinkedIn, whose engagement is lighter than that of most other popular social networks, says the platform is now producing 30K+ long-form posts per week.

CC sub growth is expected to decline Q/Q in FQ1 (partly due to seasonality), but then increase in each of the following three quarters. Digital media annual recurring revenue (ARR) is expected to follow a similar trend. Adobe aims to end FY15 with 5.9M CC subs (+70% Y/Y).
Thanks to the shift to CC subscriptions from up-front licenses, standard guidance is light: Adobe expects FQ1 revenue of $1.05B-$1.1B and EPS of $0.34-$0.40 vs. a consensus of $1.1B and $0.39. FY15 (ends Oct. '15) guidance is for revenue of $4.85B and EPS of $2.05 vs. a consensus of $4.93B and $2.07.
Creative revenue is expected to grow ""significantly"" in FY15. Marketing Cloud (online ad tech) revenue and bookings to respectively rise 25% and 30%. Document Services (Acrobat) is expected to grow slightly; Print and Publishing and LiveCycle/Web Conferencing are expected to decline slightly.
Marketing Cloud revenue, also affected by a shift towards subscription revenue streams, rose 4% Y/Y to $330.2M. However, FY14 bookings were up over 30%. Document Services revenue fell 1% to $197.1M.
$127M was spent on buybacks in FQ4. GAAP opex rose 2% Y/Y to $807.4M.

UBS' Brent Thill (Buy) thinks Adobe could deliver FY17 EPS of $4.00 (well above FY15 guidance of $2.05), and that a $100/share valuation would be justified under such circumstances given ""high visibility, high teens/low 20s rev growth, and 20%+ sustainable EPS growth.""

Among other things, Anmuth cites ""the transition from desktop to mobile search, continued margin compression, and increasing competition from Facebook.""
The indirect challenge posed by Facebook to Google's ad dollars was raised by some following Google's Q3 miss. Meanwhile, Facebook's Atlas (display ad-buying/measuring) and Audience Network (mobile ad network) platforms directly compete against Google's DoubleClick and AdMob units.
The ability of Google search to deliver ads directly tied to user intent (i.e. what a user is looking to buy at a particular moment) still acts as a key selling point when battling for ad dollars. Facebook's ad targeting, by contrast, is often driven by previously-obtained user data.

Google ended Q4 with $64.4B in cash/marketable securities, and $5.2B in debt. Speculation that dividends and/or buybacks might finally happen has grown a bit lately.

Forex is expected to have a 4% impact on FQ4 revenue growth, up from 3% in FQ3. The unearned revenue balance ($20.2B at the end of FQ3, +4% Y/Y) is expected to rise Q/Q, in-line with seasonality save for forex.
In its earnings slides (.ppt), Microsoft notes Office consumer revenue fell 41% Y/Y. 27% of the decline is attributed to the transition to Office 365 subscriptions from up-front licenses, and the rest to weak Japanese sales (they were strong a year ago ahead of a tax hike). ""Windows Phone"" revenue (includes Android royalties) fell 19% thanks to a mix shift towards low-royalty phones.
Xbox platform revenue fell 24% due to lower Xbox One sales and a mix shift towards cheaper models. Lumia phone sales (8.6M) were up 18% Y/Y; 24.7M non-Lumia phones were sold (down Y/Y).
Premium versions of Windows Server, System Center, and SQL Server were a strong point: Their collective sales rose 25% ahead of the July end of Windows Server 2003 support.

His target remains at $50.
Sherlund, who downgraded in January on account of Microsoft's FQ2 numbers, still thinks the company will be in a transition period for a few quarters, and notes certain core businesses (e.g. Windows, traditional Office licenses) were soft. However, he thinks total Office revenue (traditional + 365) could start rising again in 2016 ""given high interest and migrations among business users to Office 365 and new cross platform productivity tools for Windows, iOS and Android.""
""In our view, Microsoft is well ahead of its large cap value peer group in the transition to the cloud,"" says UBS' Brent Thill (Buy, $50 target). Pac Crest's Brendan Barnicle (Outperform, $50 target) observes Office 365 still covers less than 10% of the Office installed base, leaving plenty of room for growth. He estimates Azure is on a $1.5B/year revenue rate (compares with $5.16B in trailing revenue for AWS and a $6.3B/year run rate for Microsoft's broader commercial cloud ops).
On the CC (transcript), CFO Amy Hood stated Microsoft's FY15 (ends in June) opex guidance ($32.4B-$32.5B) is now $2B lower than where it initially was. Adjusting for forex and the Nokia deal, opex rose just 1% Y/Y in FQ3 thanks to job cuts. Meanwhile, Satya Nadella mentioned Office iOS/Android app downloads have topped 100M.

At least 7 other firms have hiked their targets. Amazon's market cap is at $181.6B.
JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth (upgrade to Overweight, $535 target) now values AWS at $66.3B, or 16x estimated 2016 EBITDA. ""[W]e think the reported profitability level far exceeded virtually all expectations. CSOI margins of 17% in 1Q15 and 14% in 2014 have been driven by increasing scale and greater utilization, along with additive services beyond core EC2 and S3 [computing and storage] services. When factoring in heavy depreciation, AWS has EBITDA margins of around 50%.""
Janney's Shawn Milne (upgrade to Buy): ""AWS segment margins of 16.9% in Q1, 14.2% in FY14 — well ahead of general Street thoughts that AWS was in 'investment mode,' and losing 5-10% (or more)."" He does note Amazon's North American retail op. margin fell to 2.5% in 2014 from 2.8% in 2013 (thanks largely to the Fire Phone debacle), but adds it rebounded to 3.9% in Q1.
Raymond James' James Kessler (upgrade to Outperform) focuses on Amazon's total margin improvement. ""Non-GAAP operating margin of 3.1% was ~100 bp above our/consensus estimates driven by improved gross margins and modestly lower than expected operating expenses. Amazon also guided 2Q margins above consensus at the high end.""
On SA, Brian Nichols argues AWS would be worth $50B at 45x forward op. income, and thinks the business could be valued at $85B if publicly traded by itself. The Panoramic View: ""Facebook and other leading tech companies used to garner a 10x revenue valuation when they were in similar stages of development. I think that the same can be applied to AWS.""

Adobe's aggressive and flexible pricing options for Stock, which targets a $3B/year stock photo market, have drawn attention: CC subs can pay $10 for 1 image, $30/month for 10 monthly images (unused images get rolled over), and $199/month for 750 images.

Following 281 days of availability the 6 and 6+ are both selling in the U.S. at 72% of their MSRPs, compared with 60% and 48% from the 5S and 5C at the same point in time.

MSFT|"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) guides on its FQ4 CC for its various reporting segments to collectively see FQ1 revenue of $20.7B-$21.3B, below a $22.8B consensus. The company has been guiding cautiously for several quarters.
Forex is expected to have a 5% impact on FQ1 and FQ2 sales growth. Microsoft promises ""Windows 10 momentum"" will provide a lift during the second half of FY16 (ends June '16), and that Bing (responsible for major losses in past years) will turn profitable during the year. In the wake of the company's latest job cut announcement, FY16 operating expense guidance has been cut to $32.1B-$32.4B. The tax rate is expected to be at 24% (+/- 1%).
Ahead of the job cuts and the related narrowing of Microsoft's phone efforts, phone revenue fell 38% Y/Y to $1.23B (feature phone decline), with a negative gross margin. Lumia units rose 10% to 8.4M, but Lumia revenue fell due to a lower ASP.
Also: 1) Though revenue fell 5% Y/Y, the unearned revenue balance rose 1% Y/Y to $25.3B, and the contracted but not billed balance rose by ~$500M to $24.5B. 2) Office 365 consumer subs rose by nearly 3M Q/Q to 15.2M; traditional Office consumer revenue fell 42%. 3) Xbox shipments rose 30% to 1.4M. 4) Azure revenue and compute usage rose by triple digits Y/Y, and enterprise mobility management (EMM) software customers rose by nearly 90% to 17K+. 5) FQ4 capex totaled $1.7B.
Microsoft is down to $45.38 in AH trading, maintaining the losses seen after the FQ4 report was published.

AAPL|"Cowen has downgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Market Perform after the company beat FQ3 estimates, offered light FQ4 guidance, and reported slightly below-consensus iPhone sales. Others on the Street are reiterating their existing ratings (largely bullish).

Upbeat on Monday, Cowen's Tim Arcuri now thinks ""evidence of a widespread demand reset from China is mounting."" He cites not only FQ3 iPhone sales, but also Chinese auto sales figures and results from multiple chipmakers. In addition, Arcuri states field work suggests new iPhone builds are down relative to the past cycle for the first time. ""[W]hile we are very bullish about AAPL’s ability to tap into a much broader and deeper demand opportunity for a price-reduced 6/6+ than prior 'old' models, this is a different narrative.""
UBS' Steve Milunovich (Buy): ""Our call that the phone ASP would be $660 was correct but we overestimated units, especially with channel inventory declining ... Despite seasonally low iPhone units, we believe Apple is building long-term value and maintain our $150 price target. Also, it is unclear if Sep guidance includes 6s sales to China, which were delayed into October last year.”
Canaccord's Mike Walkley (Buy): ""[W]e believe the current iPhone 6 and upcoming iPhone 6s should continue to post strong sales and high-end smartphone market share gains ... with only 27% of the iPhone installed base having upgraded to the iPhone 6/6 Plus devices by [FQ3], we anticipate continued strong replacement sales through 2015.""
""As Apple has become the 'gold standard' of technology, it is held to a higher standard,"" argues FBR's Daniel Ives (Outperform). With Greater China revenue up 112% Y/Y in FQ3, he considers China concerns overblown, but wants to see more transparency regarding Watch sales.

AMZN|"Not surprisingly, analysts are rushing to hike their Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) targets as shares jump following a Q2 beat fueled in part by an 81% Y/Y increase in AWS revenue. Barclays and B. Riley have upgraded to bullish ratings; several firms were prescient enough to upgrade prior to earnings. Amazon has given back some of yesterday's AH gains; its market cap is at $251B.
In addition to AWS growth, Amazon's 390 bps Y/Y gross margin improvement is drawing attention. FBN's Shebly Seyrafi (Outperform) attributes the gains to AWS, 3rd-party seller unit growth (45% of paid units vs. 41% in Q1 and a year ago), and lower shipping costs (4.1% of revenue vs. 4.4% in Q1 and 4.8% a year ago). Credit Suisse's Stephen Ju (Outperform) also thinks favorable Japanese comps helped, while adding the Prime price hike and past warehouse investments are cutting shipping loss margins.
Mizuho's Neil Doshi (Buy): ""Revenue growth (ex-FX) accelerated to 27% YoY vs. 21% YoY in 1Q, which marked the strongest growth we’ve in about 3 years. Gross Margins reached a record high of ~35%, and CSOI margin was 4.6%; the strongest we’ve seen since 1Q11. While Amazon continues to invest in the biz, the flywheels are kicking in – Prime subscribers are transacting more on Amazon, while investments in FCs, 3P and AWS are helping to drive margins higher.”
SunTrust's Bob Peck (Neutral) cautions Amazon's spending history could mean recent margin/profit improvements will be short-lived. ""Amazon has a history of 'giving back' operational efficiencies to consumers via lower prices, as well as aggressively investing to drive long- term [free cash flow] growth. Key initiatives include 1) marketplace, particularly on adding fulfillment centers, increasing [fulfillment] for 3P sellers, and expanding in India; 2) Prime, especially on adding content and expanding Prime Now; 3) AWS, adding new features/functionality as well as geographic expansion (new region in India). As a result, we expect margins to trend lower from 4Q’15 onward.”
On the earnings call (transcript), new CFO Brian Olsavsky stated paid units rose 22% Y/Y, and active customer accounts by 7M Q/Q to 285M. When asked about AWS' growth pickup, he noted major price cuts carried out in Q2 2014 led to favorable comps.

Many details are still being worked on, but the loans will be marketed under the JPMorgan brand and stay on its balance sheet, making OnDeck more technology vendor, rather than lending partner.
Large banks have generally retreated from small-business lending as it's not that profitable - an equation maybe the technology (not to mention the high rates) of online lenders could change. For its part, JPMorgan moved Piepszak to her new role earlier this year in hope of capitalizing on the cross-selling opportunities between small-business banking, credit-card, and payment processing services.

That means he'll help lead Facebook's partnerships tied to connectivity, including a recent deal to lay a new trans-Atlantic data cable with Microsoft as well as the Terragraph urban project.    Facebook says, however, that it's definitely not getting into the service-provider business like Google Fiber is, and that Lo will not work on the controversial Free Basics emerging-markets app.|2016-06-24|-0.041954891308966125|33.76100158691406

It's also no secret that Tesla has a heavy debt load in front of the Model 3 production ramp up. The SolarCity business is targeted to add $1B to Tesla's revenue in 2017 and $500M in cash over three years. Cost savings of $150M per year are also promised. ""I think your faith will be rewarded,"" CEO Elon Musk told shareholders yesterday.
Analysts are divided of course, although it's notable that a few more have upped long-term revenue projections for the energy side of the business.

The idea of another bidder for Whole Foods is also rather interesting when the broad carnage across the retail sector being seen today is considered.

He poses three possibilities: ""(1) some portion of warranty  expenses are being accrued in 'Services and Other', though we note that  TSLA's overall warranty accruals appear generous vs. other  manufacturers, and the company states that it includes all warranty  expense in its Automotive segment; (2) post warranty work is high and  being done for free, resulting in limited Services revenues but  escalating COGS; or (3) there is some other incremental service cost  associated with Model 3 (given that Service revenues and COGs appeared  to diverge at the time of Model 3 ramp).""Sacconaghi reaffirms his Market Perform rating and $265 price target on the shares."|2018-06-22|-0.08241036155948611|22.242000579833984

The investment manager is sticking with its long-term forecast for 80% gross margins for Tesla as transportation evolves into a service model. Ark CEO Cathie Wood says Tesla's new chip is about three years ahead of rivals (CNBC video). Ark's thesis on Tesla hinges on the potential in the MaaS market: ""ARK estimates that electric vehicle sales will outpace expectations in the next five years, reaching 17 million units sold in 2022, and Tesla will be a market leader. Perhaps more importantly, the autonomous MaaS market, which according to our research should be valued in trillions of dollars today given the massive future cash flows, is nowhere to be seen in most valuation models."" Ark Invest held 315K shares of Tesla as of March 15, according to Bloomberg data."|2018-08-21|0.0524548267272571|21.459999084472656

GOOG|"On the net neutrality front, new research suggests that the country's biggest telecoms are slowing traffic to some of the most popular apps -- particularly video, including YouTube (GOOG -1.7%, GOOGL -1.6%) and Netflix (NFLX -1.2%).    YouTube is the top target of throttling, according to the study from Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. But data speeds are also slowing for Amazon Prime Video (AMZN +1.4%) and the NBC Sports app (CMCSA -1.3%), based on research using the smartphone app Wehe.    The study calls out ""differentiation"" in traffic treatment in more than 11,100 occasions by Verizon (VZ -2.5%); 8,398 times by AT&T (T -0.7%); nearly 3,900 times at T-Mobile (TMUS -0.4%); and 339 times at Sprint (S +0.1%).

AMZN|Some grocery stocks are seeing volatile trading after hours as details emerge about the late-day report that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is looking at opening up to 3,000 cashierless stores by 2021 -- its latest major shot across the bow of an entrenched industry.    Amazon finished down 0.8% and is near flat after hours. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is flat postmarket while Kroger (NYSE:KR) has swung back to a 1.2% after-hours gain following a finish down 1.4%. Target (NYSE:TGT) is down 0.2% in late trading after closing down 0.6%.    Bloomberg's report paints a picture of something in between a fast-meal location like Pret A Manger or Subway, and a 7-Eleven style convenience store with more groceries in addition to prepared meals.    CEO Jeff Bezos thinks the company's best chance to disrupt brick-and-mortar shopping may be mealtime logjams in busy cities, according to the report.    Either route the company pursues will be expensive. The original AmazonGo cashierless store in downtown Seattle needed $1M in hardware alone to enable the sensors to allow people to scan in on entry and simply walk out with what they wanted.    But sticking to prepared foods rather than groceries would require fewer cameras and sensors, and those goods have a wider profit margin than groceries do.The U.S. currently has 155,000 convenience stores, with 122,500 of them combined with gas stations; nonfuel purchases at those stores were $233B in 2016, led by tobacco products.|2018-09-19|0.01905010971337684|96.32099914550781

Hall: ""It also looks like the balance of price and features in the iPhone XR may not have been well-received by users outside of the US.""
Hall says the two-week period starting a week before Christmas day has historically provided a disproportionate chunk of December quarter demand, which could change the iPhone demand picture. But Hall doesn't expect this to happen.
The firm's estimates stay at the lower end of Apple's guidance range and think the company likely included the more negative scenario in the guidance. But there is material risk to the March quarter guide if current demand trends continue.
